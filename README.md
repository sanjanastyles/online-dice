A really fun way to create your own Arbiter ðŸ˜‚ Change Player's name and find out who shall have The Last Bite.</br>
Here's an explanation to the source code. I've also provided images in images folder, if you wish to use images instead of making a dice of your own in CSS, you can use the following code explanation to help guide you.

<div>

## HTML
### Using Image folder

<p> In this case we will display dice cubes as images, For which we will have to declare them as follows in the body tag of div `dice` </p>

```html
<img class="img" src="images/dice6.png" />
```

<div>

## JavaScript

### Using Image folder

<p>

We find random number to change our dice's value. As the dice's value will be in range of `1 to 6`.

```js
Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
```

we use `Math.floor()` method which rounds a number DOWN to the nearest integer, as we need to avoid getting random non-integer numbers.

</p>
<p>

As we use the following as our image source, to cut down the complexity of our code. And hence we save our images as `"dice(number).png"`.

```js
"images/dice" + randomNumber + ".png";
```

</p>
<p>

Now that we've got our image sources, all that's left is to change the source in HTML. To do the same we need to change the src of `<img class="img" src="images/dice6.png" />`

```js
document
  .querySelectorAll("img")
  [n - 1].setAttribute("src", randomImageSource - n);
```

</p>
combine them all to get:

### The Original Code

#### Theme Alter

```js
useDark.addListener((evt) => toggleDarkMode(evt.matches));
```

<p>Determines the user's color preference even before they switch their website's theme using the `theme` button.</p>

<p> When `useDark.matches` is true, i.e the user's OS is set t o dark mode it will call on to the function  `toggleDarkMode` to set the SCSS to `dark-mode`. </p>

```js
toggleDarkMode(useDark.matches);

function toggleDarkMode(state) {
  document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark-mode", state);
}
```

### Dice Result

<p> Random number is determined using the same steps as mentioned above. Here we use class to display our dice. </p>

```js
var ResultClass = "result-" + randomNumber;
```

<p>By removing `currentClass` we can keep showing random dice faces using classes, as we need to avoid class repetition, keeping confusion on bay. </p>

````js
  if ( currentClass ) {
    cube.classList.remove( currentClass );
  }
````
</div>

<div>

## SCSS
### Images Folder
<p>I hope you can figure styling for  dices using IMAGES FOLDER. But a PS: A survey states that most people like their images little less popped when using dark mode. A trick to do that is using the following in my opinion. Good Luck.</p>

```scss
img:not([src*='.svg']) {
  filter: var(--image-filter);
}
```

### Original Code

<p>As we've seen in the JavaScript part, we are going to display the resulted dice face using a class namely `result- + random number`. To give a `#3D` effect to or dices. </p>

```scss
transform-style: preserve-3d;
transform: translateZ(-100px);
  ```
